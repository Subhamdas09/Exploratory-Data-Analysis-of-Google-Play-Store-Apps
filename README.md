# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Google-Play-Store-Apps
Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Play Store Apps
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store dataset to understand the mobile app ecosystem, uncover trends, and generate actionable insights.

🔍 ##Objectives

Analyze the distribution of apps across different categories.
Compare Free vs Paid apps and their popularity.
Study the impact of Content Ratings on app availability.
Understand how Ratings, Installs, Size, and Price relate to each other.
Identify key factors that influence an app’s success.

⚙️ ##Workflow
Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates & irrelevant columns.
Handled missing values.
Standardized formats for installs, ratings, and price.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Countplots, histograms, and distribution plots.
Relationship analysis between installs, ratings, and app type.
Category-wise breakdown of apps and installs.
Free vs Paid analysis with revenue-related insights.

##Visualization
Seaborn & Matplotlib used for visual storytelling.
Clear plots with professional formatting and labels.

📈 ##Key Insights
Most apps are Free → Monetization happens via ads/in-app purchases.
Games, Family, and Tools dominate the Play Store by volume.
“Everyone” is the most common content rating.
Paid apps are rare and concentrated in education/productivity categories.
Apps with higher installs tend to have better ratings (social proof).
Larger apps are often in Games, but size doesn’t strongly affect ratings.

🚀 ##Business Impact
Developers should focus on free apps with ad revenue models.
Categories like Games, Tools, and Family have the largest audiences.
Maintaining high ratings and reviews is crucial for visibility and installs.
Niche paid apps in education & productivity can still find success.
